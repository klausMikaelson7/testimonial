            <h5 class="intro">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so,
              in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny‚Äôs worth.</h3>

              <p class="infotext">‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been looking to make a
                transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
                for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
                The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
                the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù</p>

            <h5 class="intro">The team was very supportive and kept me motivated</h5>
              <p class="infotext baam">‚Äú I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now work as a mobile engineer for a big company.
              This was one of the best investments I‚Äôve made in myself. ‚Äù</p>

              <p>Verified Graduate</p>
            </div>
            <h5 class="intro">Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and
              learning from their experiences was easy.</h5>

              <p class="infotext">‚Äú The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program
              gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
              junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from
              an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ‚Äù</p>

          <p>Verified Graduate</p>

        </div>
        <h5 class="intro boom">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h5>

        <p class="infotext baam">‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
          professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
          student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
          did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
          project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
          could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
          experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
          100% recommend! ‚Äù</p>
